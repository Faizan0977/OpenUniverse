/**
 * <p>
 * CommandTo class.</p>
 *
 * @since 1.0.21
 */
/**
 * Represents a system command execution configuration.
 *
 * The {@code CommandTo} class defines the parameters needed to execute a command-line 
 * process, including the command itself, its working directory, environment variables, 
 * arguments, error logging, and concurrency settings.
 *
 * This class provides a structured way to configure and manage the execution of 
 * system commands or scripts, making it useful for automation, scripting, and process management.
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * CommandTo command = new CommandTo();
 * command.cmd = "java";
 * command.workingDir = "/home/user/projects";
 * command.envVars = Map.of("JAVA_HOME", "/usr/lib/jvm/java-17");
 * command.args = List.of("-jar", "app.jar", "--debug");
 * command.errorLogFile = "/var/logs/app_errors.log";
 * command.instancesCount = 3;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>JSON Representation:</h2>
 * This class can be serialized into a JSON structure for easy storage and transmission.

 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety:</h2>
 * This class is not inherently thread-safe. If used in a multi-threaded environment, 
 * external synchronization should be considered when modifying its properties.
 *
 * <h2>Limitations:</h2>
 * - The command must be available on the system where it is executed.
 * - The working directory must be valid, or execution may fail.
 * - Environment variables should be correctly set to avoid unintended behavior.
 * - If the specified error log file is not writable, error logging may fail.
 * - If running multiple instances, system resource limits should be considered.
