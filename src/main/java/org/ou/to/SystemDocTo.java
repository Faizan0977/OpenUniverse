    /**  
     * Represents the connection definition for an arbitrary abstract system in JSON format.  
     *
     * This field stores the necessary parameters and metadata required to establish  
     * a connection with different types of systems, such as operating systems, databases,  
     * satellite equipment, and IoT networks. The JSON structure defines connection details  
     * such as host, authentication credentials, protocols, and configurations.  
     *
     * <h2>Example Use Cases:</h2>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Operating System:</b> Remote SSH access details, authentication keys,  
     *       and system monitoring configurations.</li>
     *   <li><b>Database System:</b> Connection parameters like hostname, port, credentials,  
     *       and SSL settings.</li>
     *   <li><b>Satellite Equipment:</b> Communication link settings, telemetry endpoints,  
     *       and encryption methods.</li>
     *   <li><b>IoT Network:</b> Device connection details, MQTT broker settings,  
     *       and secure API endpoints.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h2>Example JSON Representations:</h2>
     *
     * <b>Operating System Connection (SSH):</b>
     * <pre>
     * {
     *   "system_type": "Linux",
     *   "host": "192.168.1.10",
     *   "port": 22,
     *   "auth": {
     *     "method": "ssh_key",
     *     "key_path": "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"
     *   },
     *   "monitoring_enabled": true
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <b>Database Connection:</b>
     * <pre>
     * {
     *   "db_type": "PostgreSQL",
     *   "host": "db.example.com",
     *   "port": 5432,
     *   "username": "admin",
     *   "password": "securePass",
     *   "ssl_enabled": true
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <b>Satellite Equipment Connection:</b>
     * <pre>
     * {
     *   "satellite_id": "SAT-2025-001",
     *   "ground_station": "EarthStation-Alpha",
     *   "communication": {
     *     "protocol": "S-band",
     *     "frequency": "2.2 GHz",
     *     "encryption": "AES-256"
     *   }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <b>IoT Device Connection:</b>
     * <pre>
     * {
     *   "device_id": "IoT-12345",
     *   "broker_url": "mqtt://broker.example.com",
     *   "port": 8883,
     *   "credentials": {
     *     "client_id": "device-client",
     *     "token": "secure-auth-token"
     *   }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <h2>Considerations:</h2>
     * - Ensure that the JSON structure follows the expected schema for the target system.  
     * - Sensitive credentials should be stored securely and not logged.  
     * - Can be parsed using libraries such as Jackson, Gson, or org.json.
