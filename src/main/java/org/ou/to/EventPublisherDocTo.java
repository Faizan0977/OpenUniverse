     * Represents the command execution configuration.
     *
     * This field holds an instance of {@link CommandTo}, which defines the parameters 
     * required to execute a system command. It includes the command itself, its working 
     * directory, environment variables, arguments, error logging, and concurrency settings.
     *
     * <h2>Usage Example:</h2>
     * <pre>
     * commandTo = new CommandTo();
     * commandTo.cmd = "java";
     * commandTo.workingDir = "/home/user/projects";
     * commandTo.envVars = Map.of("JAVA_HOME", "/usr/lib/jvm/java-17");
     * commandTo.args = List.of("-jar", "app.jar", "--debug");
     * commandTo.errorLogFile = "/var/logs/app_errors.log";
     * commandTo.instancesCount = 3;
     * </pre>
     *
     * <h2>JSON Representation:</h2>
     * When serialized to JSON, this field will be represented as an embedded object.
     * <pre>
     * {
     *   "command": {
     *     "cmd": "java",
     *     "working_dir": "/home/user/projects",
     *     "env_vars": { "JAVA_HOME": "/usr/lib/jvm/java-17" },
     *     "args": ["-jar", "app.jar", "--debug"],
     *     "error_log_file": "/var/logs/app_errors.log",
     *     "instances_count": 3
     *   }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <h2>Considerations:</h2>
     * - Ensure that {@code commandTo} is properly initialized before use.
     * - If {@code commandTo} is null, execution-related operations may fail.
